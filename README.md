Git
===
Common git commands:

`git status` – view information about the current repo (also current branch)

`git pull` – get changes from a remote repo

`git branch <branch>` – create new branch (on your computer!)

`git checkout <branch>` – switch to another branch (only if there is nothing to commit)

`git add <file>` – add file to the index (track file)

`git commit -m "Commit message"` – commit changes (of tracked files)

`git push --set-upstream origin <branch>` – send branch to a remote repo

`git checkout --track origin/<branch>` – add remote branch to local repo

`git push` – send changes to a remote repo

`git merge <branch>` – merge another branch to the current branch


`git log` – view the history of the current repo

`git log --all --decorate --oneline --graph` – fancy way to see the history

`git checkout -b <branch>` – create new local branch and switch to it


Basic algorithm:
* git pull
* git merge
* make changes
* git add
* git commit
* git push
